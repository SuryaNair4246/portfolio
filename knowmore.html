            <p>I’m based in Richmond Virginia, where I live with my wonderful family. When I’m not crafting intuitive user experiences , you can find me in the kitchen experimenting with new recipes—cooking is one of my true passions! Whether it’s trying out a new dish or perfecting a family favorite, there’s something about creating meals that bring people together that I really enjoy.I’m also a proud parent of twin girls who loves spending time with my kids, whether we’re playing games, exploring the outdoors, or simply having fun at home. Balancing my professional life with quality family time is something I value deeply, and it keeps me grounded and inspired.I bring the same creativity and care to my design work as I do to my family life—whether it’s designing a smooth user flow or making a new meal, I’m always focused on making the experience as enjoyable and meaningful as possible.</p>
